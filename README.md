# Steganography
This project hide very long messages in images with high security using the genetic algorithm
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
****Stegnography **********
- how to use:
1- proposed algorithm 
Go to codes/proposed method --> run MainFile.m 
you can change the image, message, algorithm parameters by editing the MainFile.m
2- benchMark
Go to codes\Benchmark code (Image hiding using GA)\Benchmark code (Image hiding using GA)
--> run MainFile.m 
you can change the image, message by editing the MainFile.m
you can change the algorithm parameters by editing GApart.m file 
********************************
results visualization:
Go to visualization --> run MainFile.m for Distoration measures and statistical security measures
                    --> run MainRS.m for RS analysis and smoothness
                    --> run plotHistOfDiff.m for plotting the histogram of difference
